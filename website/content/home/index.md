# Daniel Duclos-Cavalcanti

I'm a Computer and Electrical Engineer from the Technical University of Munich, where I'm also soon to receive a M.Sc. Degree from. Currently, I'm completing the very last credit for this program externally in <b>New York</b>, via research work in collaboration with [Dr. Sivaraman](https://anirudhsk.github.io/) and [PhD. Haseeb Ashfaq](https://haseeblums.github.io/) at [Systems@NYU](https://news.cs.nyu.edu/).


The project in question revolves around [Jasper: a Scalable and Fair Multicast Solution for Financial Exchanges in the Cloud@NYU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527) . Jasper leverages the current desire to migrate financial exchanges to the public cloud and given the lack of a cloud-native multicast mechanism for such, it presents itself as a modern solution. My collaboration revolves around
developing a performant heuristic to re-configure Jasper's multicast-tree based on present cloud conditions both at runtime and startup.
