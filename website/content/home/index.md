# Daniel Duclos-Cavalcanti

I'm a Computer and Electrical Engineer from the Technical University of Munich, where I'm also soon to receive a M.Sc. Degree from. Currently, I'm completing the last credit for this program externally in New York, via research work in collaboration with [Dr. Sivaraman](https://anirudhsk.github.io/) and [PhD. Haseeb Ashfaq](https://haseeblums.github.io/) from [Systems@NYU](https://news.cs.nyu.edu/).


The project in question revolves around __Jasper: a Scalable and Fair Multicast Solution for Financial Exchanges in the Cloud__. Jasper leverages the current desire to migrate financial exchanges to the public cloud and given the lack of a cloud-native multicast mechanism for such, it presents itself as a modern solution. My collaboration revolves around
developing a performant heuristic to re-configure Jasper's multicast-tree based on present cloud conditions both at runtime and startup.

Beyond my recent collaboration around cloud-based distributed systems research, I also have a background in 
Embedded Systems and FPGA Engineering, as well as highly enjoy developing on Linux and/or UNIX systems. Feel
