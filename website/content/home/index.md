# Home

I'm a Computer and Electrical Engineer from the Technical University of Munich, where I'm also soon to receive a M.Sc. Degree from as well. Currently, I'm completing the very last credit for this program externally in New York, via research work in collaboration with with [Dr.Sivaraman](https://anirudhsk.github.io/) and [PhD. Haseeb Ashfaq](https://haseeblums.github.io/) at [Systems@NYU](https://news.cs.nyu.edu/).

The project in question revolves around: 
- _[Jasper: a Scalable and Fair Multicast Solution for Financial Exchanges in the Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527)_. 
- _[LemonDrop: a Method of Selecting and Scheduling VMs optimized for a latency-sensitive Application](https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:xq718qd4043/Vig_thesis_submission-augmented.pdf)_


My master thesis aims to construct a performant heuristic to re-configure Jasper's multicast-tree based on present cloud conditions, 
that vary highly through time.
