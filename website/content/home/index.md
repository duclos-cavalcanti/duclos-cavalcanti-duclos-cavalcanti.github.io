# Daniel Duclos-Cavalcanti

I'm a Computer Engineer living in New York with a bachelors and masters from the Technical University of Munich, in Germany. 
Currently, collaborating on research with [Dr.Sivaraman](https://anirudhsk.github.io/) and [PhD. Haseeb Ashfaq](https://haseeblums.github.io/) from [Systems@NYU](https://news.cs.nyu.edu/).


The project revolves around [Jasper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527): A Scalable Design and Implementation of a Financial Exchange in the Cloud. Beyond co-authoring and aiding in the development of Jasper, my thesis constructed a performant heuristic to 
select VMs based on present cloud conditions to improve Jasper's overall performance, both before and during runtime.

- [Jasper: Design And Implementation of A Scalable Financial Exchange in the Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527)
- [SIGCOMM24 POSTER - Jasper, A Scalable and Fair Multicast for Fin. Exch. in the Cloud](https://sigcomm24posterdemo.hotcrp.com/paper/47?cap=hcav47KhCcppMuxCoAApCEhcdjiFGC)
- [Cloud TreeFinder](https://github.com/duclos-cavalcanti/master-arbeit): _Private until October 3rd_

Beyond my recent collaboration around cloud-based distributed systems research, I also have a background in 
Embedded Systems and FPGA Engineering, as well as developing on and for Linux/UNIX systems. Feel 
free to contact me or take a look at my resume.
