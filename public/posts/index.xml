      <description>After a challenging year I finally defended my master thesis on &amp;ldquo;VM Selection for Financial Exchanges in the Cloud&amp;rdquo;. This collaborative effort was done as my master&amp;rsquo;s degree final credit at my alma mater the Technical University of Munich. Throughout this work I was by co-advised by PhD. Muhammad Haseeeb and Dr.Anirudh Sivaraman from Systems@NYU, as well as PhD. Navidreza Asadi and Prof. Dr.-Ing. Wolfgang Kellerer from LKN at TUM. The entirety of the code and relevant documentation can be found on github.</description>
