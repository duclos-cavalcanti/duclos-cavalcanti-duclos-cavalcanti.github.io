I'm an American Computer Engineer by the Technical University of Munich. Currently, finishing an M.Sc. degree through an exchange at the New York University. 

I'm collaborating with Dr.Sivaraman and his research team at Systems@NYU on a project around High-Performance Multicasting on the Cloud for Financial Exchanges. A link to a pre-print of that work, currently called Jasper, can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527). My ongoing thesis, also co-advised by Prof. Sivaraman, builds upon that work and aims to be delivered around early August. 
It can be followed as well through [this link](https://github.com/duclos-cavalcanti/master-arbeit).

Previously, as I interviewed with the mentioned professor to work with his team, he spoke about his research around High-Frequency Trading and the computing infrastructures that support it. I wasn't aware of how interesting these systems were and as a son of two economists, it felt like an amazing crossover between my background and the career I've chosen. 

I've heard of HRT both through personal friends, as well as through several the University's job portal. I've found the way HRT employs technology at a high level within financial exchanges extremely interesting and also the value placed on good engineering and science was equally fulfilling to me personally. I truly believe that my profile, my knowledge in FPGAs, Linux, Computer and Software Engineering, as well as the current pivot in interest around the computing infrastructures of financial exchanges, makes me a great candidate for your company. 

Moreover, as someone who is always seeking to learn and adores an intellectually challenging environment, I see HRT as a place where I could reach my true potential as an engineer.
