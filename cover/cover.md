I'm an American and Brazilian Computer Engineer currently finishing an M.Sc. degree through an exchange at New York University. I earned
my B.Sc. Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Technical University of Munich in Germany, where I'll also soon obtain my master's degree in the same field.

I'm finishing the very last credit for this program externally in New York via a collaboration with with [Dr.Sivaraman](https://anirudhsk.github.io/) and his research team at [Systems@NYU](https://news.cs.nyu.edu/).
The project in question revolves around _Jasper: a Scalable and Fair Multicasting on the Cloud for Financial Exchanges_ [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527). Beyond aiding in it's development, my thesis aims to construct a performant heuristic to re-configure Jasper's multicast-tree based on present cloud conditions, that vary highly through time.

I've always been a curious individual, and I believe that trait is not only one of my defining qualities but also one that pushed me to experience as much as I could as an engineer and as a person. I've had the privilege and the determination to study and work both in Germany and now in the U.S. across a multitude of interesting domains, from digital design to operating systems, computer networking, cloud computing, machine learning and more.
I believe my broad knowledge across these various fields, coupled with my creative and determined work ethic, equips me extremely well for a career in engineering.

I'm confident that I would be a great addition to Datadog. The strong learning culture, global presence and seemingly eclectic workforce makes for a perfect fit. Moreover, Datadog's position as a SaaS provider in the cloud computing space matches very well with my background in servers, computer networking and kernel engineering. Finally, I personally love the task of developing tooling from engineers to other engineers. Throughout my time as a student and engineer, I always held the belief that many times great tools can be the difference needed for breakthrough and innovation both in science as well as in the industry. I admire Datadog's attempt to provide value in that regard.

<!-- Recently, I have developed a keen interest in High-Frequency Trading (HFT) and the sophisticated computing infrastructures that underpin our modern financial systems. The unique engineering challenges presented by low-latency trading are particularly fascinating to me, encompassing a diverse range of technical domains such as FPGA development, advanced networking, compiler optimizations, and intricate machine learning techniques. This convergence of disciplines to address the complexities of HFT exemplifies the kind of multifaceted problem-solving that I find deeply engaging. Additionally, I am equally intrigued by the broader implications of this work, including its impact on our economy, the incentives it creates, and its role in the interconnected fabric of global finance. Understanding these dynamics offers a comprehensive view of how technological advancements in trading are shaping financial markets worldwide. -->

I'm genuinely looking forward and excited to be hearing from you.
