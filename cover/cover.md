I'm an American and Brazilian Computer Engineer currently finishing an M.Sc. degree through an exchange at New York University. I earned
my B.Sc. Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Technical University of Munich in Germany, where I'll also soon obtain my master's degree in the same field.

This final credit is done through a collaboration with Dr.Sivaraman and his research team at Systems@NYU, whose final presentation is to be delivered around late August. The work from which my thesis builds on is _Jasper: Scalable and Fair Multicasting on the Cloud for Financial Exchanges_, which is a project I still currently aid in developing  [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527).

<!-- Since my first programming class, I have been interested in understanding how programs and the machines that execute them work. -->
<!-- This curiosity eventually brought me to study both the hardware and the software mechanisms that enable us to do so. Throughout my  -->
<!-- studies and career, I was lucky and driven enough to experience many layers of computer abstractions. From digital electronics and FPGAs to  -->
<!-- Operating Systems, Linux, Networking, Machine Learning, and the Software Engineering tools that leverage them all. -->

I've always been a curious individual, and I believe that trait is not only one of my defining qualities but also one that pushed me to experience as much as I could as an engineer and as a person. I've had the privilege and the determination to study and work both in Germany and now in the U.S. across a multitude of interesting domains.

Lately, I've developed a newfound interest in Algorithmic Trading and the computing infrastructures that support modern financial systems. The engineering challenges presented in this world are particularly fascinating to me, encompassing a diverse range of fields such as FPGA development, advanced networking, machine learning, and much more. This merging of disciplines to address complex problems is the kind of work that I find incredibly engaging, as well as one that matches very well with my background.

<!-- Recently, I have developed a keen interest in High-Frequency Trading (HFT) and the sophisticated computing infrastructures that underpin our modern financial systems. The unique engineering challenges presented by low-latency trading are particularly fascinating to me, encompassing a diverse range of technical domains such as FPGA development, advanced networking, compiler optimizations, and intricate machine learning techniques. This convergence of disciplines to address the complexities of HFT exemplifies the kind of multifaceted problem-solving that I find deeply engaging. Additionally, I am equally intrigued by the broader implications of this work, including its impact on our economy, the incentives it creates, and its role in the interconnected fabric of global finance. Understanding these dynamics offers a comprehensive view of how technological advancements in trading are shaping financial markets worldwide. -->

Therefore, I am looking for new challenges in this business as a team player with great communication skills, a strong technical background, and a lifelong thirst for learning. I truly believe that makes me a great fit for your enterprise and will be looking forward to hearing from you.
