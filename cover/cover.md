I'm an American and Brazilian Computer Engineer currently finishing a M.Sc. degree through an exchange at the New York University. I earned 
my B.Sc. Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Technical University of Munich in Germany, where I am also soon to obtain my masters degree 
from.

I'm collaborating with Dr.Sivaraman and his research team at Systems@NYU on a project around High-Performance Multicasting on the Cloud for Financial Exchanges. A link to a pre-print of that work, currently called Jasper, can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527). My ongoing thesis, also co-advised by Prof. Sivaraman, builds upon that work and aims to be delivered around early August. 
It can be followed as well through [this link](https://github.com/duclos-cavalcanti/master-arbeit).


Moreover, as someone who is always seeking to learn and adores an intellectually challenging environment, I see HRT as a place where I could reach my true potential as an engineer. Finally, having been born in the U.S., but having had the opportunity to live both in Brazil, as well as in Germany, I welcome the diverse and international environment that seems to be prevalent in your team!
