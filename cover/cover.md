I'm an American Computer Engineer from the Technical University of Munich. Currently, finishing an M.Sc. degree through an exchange at the New York University. 

I'm collaborating with Dr.Sivaraman and his research team at Systems@NYU on a project around High-Performance Multicasting on the Cloud, aimed at aiding the potential transition of High-Frequency Trading's current infrastructure to the public cloud.  A link to a pre-print of that work, currently called Jasper, will be available at the end of this letter.

My ongoing thesis, also co-advised by Prof. Sivaraman, should be delivered around late July / early August. The main goal is to develop a heuristic to better choose a subset of VMs on a platform that fits the latency needs imposed by Jasper. Previously, as I interviewed the mentioned professor to work with his team, he spoke about his research around High-Frequency Trading and the computing infrastructures that support it. I wasn't aware of how interesting these systems were and as a son of two economists, it felt like an amazing crossover between my background and the career I've chosen. 

I've heard of Jane Street both through personal friends, as well as through the Professor's class on "Technologies in Finance" currently underway this Spring Term. I've found the way Jane Street employs technology at a high level within financial exchanges extremely interesting and also the value placed on good engineering and science was equally fulfilling to me personally. I truly believe that my profile, my knowledge in FPGAs, Linux, Computer and Software Engineering, as well as the current pivot in interest around the computing infrastructures of financial exchanges, makes me a great candidate for your company. 

Moreover, as someone who is always seeking to learn and adores an intellectually challenging environment, I see Jane Street as a place where I could reach my true potential as an engineer. I'm looking forward to hearing from you.
