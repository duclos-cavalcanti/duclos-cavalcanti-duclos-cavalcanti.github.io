I'm an American and Brazilian Computer Engineer currently finishing an M.Sc. degree through an exchange at New York University. I earned 
my B.Sc. Electrical and Computer Engineering from the Technical University of Munich in Germany, where I am also soon to obtain my master's degree 
in the same field.

This final work is done through a collaboration with Dr.Sivaraman and his research team at Systems@NYU. The project on which my thesis is based is on High-Performance Multicasting on the Cloud for Financial Exchanges [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527). The final presentation is to be delivered around mid-August.

<!-- Since my first programming class, I have been interested in understanding how programs and the machines that execute them work. -->
<!-- This curiosity eventually brought me to study both the hardware and the software mechanisms that enable us to do so. Throughout my  -->
<!-- studies and career, I was lucky and driven enough to experience many layers of computer abstractions. From digital electronics and FPGAs to  -->
<!-- Operating Systems, Linux, Networking, Machine Learning, and the Software Engineering tools that leverage them all. -->

I've always been a curious person, and I believe that trait is not only one of my defining qualities but also one that pushed me to experience as much as I could as an engineer and as an individual. I am a quick learner, adapt extremely well to new environments and problems, and am continuously motivated by self-improvement. 

I truly and humbly believe, that given my personality and exposure to various computing stacks and techniques, I could be a great fit for your team.
