I believe curiosity has been my strongest and most defining trait throughout life. It was because of it 
that I pursued an education abroad, graduating in computer and electrical engineering from 
the Technical University of Munich. Today I find myself in New York, completing a masters degree 
via a research collaboration with Dr.Sivaraman from NYU in the topic of "VM Selection heuristics for 
Financial Exchanges in the Cloud".

My curiosity has been the defining quality throughout my academic and professional journey. This trait led me to pursue both a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the esteemed Technical University of Munich in Germany. Currently, I am in New York, collaborating on research with Dr. Sivaraman from NYU on VM selection heuristics for Financial Exchanges in the cloud.

I have explored a wide range of topics in both industry and research, from embedded systems and machine learning on edge devices to cloud-based distributed systems. As a dual American and Brazilian citizen, my well-rounded cultural background, versatile experiences, and passion for learning uniquely equip me for a career in engineering.


I'm an American Computer Engineer currently living in New York and finishing a M.Sc. degree from the Technical University of Munich 
through a research collaboration with [Dr.Sivaraman](https://anirudhsk.github.io/) and his team at [Systems@NYU](https://news.cs.nyu.edu/).

The project in question revolves around _Jasper: a Scalable and Fair Multicasting Solution on the Cloud for Financial Exchanges_ [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527). Beyond aiding in it's development, my thesis aims to construct a performant heuristic to re-configure Jasper's multicast-tree based on present cloud conditions, that vary highly through time.

<!-- I am confident that I am an excellent fit for Siemens, having admired the company throughout my undergraduate years for its unique position in science and engineering. My background in embedded systems, firmware, IoT, and cloud computing, along with my formative years living in Germany, makes me a strong candidate on both a technical and cultural level. Given my recent move to the United States and my past experiences, I am certain that I can provide immediate value to your team and continuously grow a successful career within Siemens as intended. -->

<!-- The strong learning culture, global presence and seemingly eclectic workforce makes for a perfect fit. Moreover, Datadog's position as a SaaS provider in the cloud computing space matches very well with my background in servers, computer networking and kernel engineering. Finally, I personally love the task of developing tooling from engineers to other engineers. Throughout my time as a student and engineer, I always held the belief that many times great tools can be the difference needed for breakthrough and innovation both in science as well as in the industry. I admire Datadog's attempt to provide value in that regard. -->

Recently, I have developed a keen interest in High-Frequency Trading (HFT) and the sophisticated computing infrastructures that underpin our modern financial systems. The unique engineering challenges presented by low-latency trading are particularly fascinating to me, encompassing a diverse range of technical domains such as FPGA development, advanced networking, compiler optimizations, and intricate machine learning techniques. This convergence of disciplines to address the complexities of HFT exemplifies the kind of multifaceted problem-solving that I find deeply engaging. Additionally, I am equally intrigued by the broader implications of this work, including its impact on our economy, the incentives it creates, and its role in the interconnected fabric of global finance. Understanding these dynamics offers a comprehensive view of how technological advancements in trading are shaping financial markets worldwide.

I'm genuinely looking forward and excited to be hearing from you.
