## About

![](/assets/images/profile.jpg){id="profile"}

I'm a Computer and Electrical Engineer from the Technical University of Munich, where I'm also soon to receive a M.Sc. Degree from as well. Currently, I'm completing the very last credit for this program externally in New York, via a collaboration with with [Dr.Sivaraman](https://anirudhsk.github.io/) and his research team at [Systems@NYU](https://news.cs.nyu.edu/).

The project in question revolves around: _[Jasper: a Scalable and Fair Multicast Solution for Financial Exchanges in the Cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527)_. Beyond aiding in it's development, my thesis aims to construct a performant heuristic to re-configure Jasper's multicast-tree based on present cloud conditions, that vary highly through time.

I was born in the United States, more specifically in Minneapolis. However, I've lived most of my formative years in Brazil, where my family takes up residence. Eventually, my studies brought me to Germany, but today, I am living in New York and am looking for full-time positions in the region within Computer Engineering ideally from September on, but could start earlier given the circumstances.

I've always been a curious individual, and I believe that trait is not only one of my defining qualities but also one that pushed me to experience as much as I could as an engineer and as a person. 

Since my first programming class, I have been interested in understanding how programs and the machines that execute them work. This curiosity eventually brought me to study both the hardware and the software mechanisms that enable us to do so. Throughout my studies and career, I was fortunate and driven enough to experience many layers of computing abstractions. From digital electronics and FPGAs to Operating Systems, Linux, Networking, Machine Learning, and the Software Engineering tools that leverage them.

I believe my broad knowledge across these various fields, coupled with my creative and determined work ethic, equips me well for a career in engineering.

## Tooling

On some level, I do believe that mastering one's tools are as important as understanding 
the craft itself. Either that, or I just enjoy hacking my setup.

Regardless, as somewhat of a hobby, when I'm not engaged in topics mentioned above, I find myself continuously learning and interested in all things UNIX. That goes from the their tools, the OSes themselves and 
extending both of them for my needs. 

I use the infamous UNIX clone - _Linux_ - on a daily basis and have done so for a long time. I am quite fond of the experience, the strong freedom within it's ecosystem and user base.

## Etc

Beyond computer science I have a variety of different interests. These go from Language and Linguistics to Comedy, Rap and even martial arts.

I am a huge fan of *Stand-up Comedy* and have been since I first saw it as a kid. Among many contemporaries, I'd say one of my favorite current comedians would be *Andrew Schulz*.
