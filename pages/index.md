I'm a Computer and Electrical Engineer from the Technical University of Munich, where I'm also soon to receive a M.Sc. Degree from as well. Currently, I'm finishing the very last credit for this program externally via a collaboration with with [Dr.Sivaraman](https://anirudhsk.github.io/) and his research team at [Systems@NYU](https://news.cs.nyu.edu/).
The project in question revolves around _[Jasper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09527): a Scalable and Fair Multicast Solution for Financial Exchanges in the Cloud_. Beyond aiding in the development of Jasper, my thesis aims to construct a performant heuristic to re-configure Jasper's multicast-tree based on present cloud conditions, that vary highly through time.

I was born in the United States, more specifically in Minneapolis. However, I've lived most of my formative years in Brazil, where my family takes up residence. Eventually, my studies brought me to Germany, but today, I am living in New York and 
am looking for full-time positions in this area within Computer/Software Engineering ideally from September on, but could start earlier given certain circumstances.

## Tooling

On some level, I do believe that mastering one's tools are as important as understanding 
the craft itself. Either that, or I just enjoy endless hacking.

Regardless, as somewhat of a hobby, when I'm not engaged in topics mentioned above, I find myself continuously learning and interested in all things UNIX. That goes from the their tools, the OSes themselves and 
extending both of them for my needs. 

I use the infamous UNIX clone - _Linux_ - on a daily basis and have done so for a long time. I am quite fond of the experience, the strong freedom within it's ecosystem and user base.

## Etc

Beyond computer science I have a variety of different interests. These go from Language and Linguistics to Comedy, Rap and even martial arts.

I am a huge fan of *Stand-up Comedy* and have been since I first saw it as a kid. Among many contemporaries, I'd say my favorite current comedians would be *Dave Chapelle*, *Ricky Gervais* and *Andrew Schulz*.
