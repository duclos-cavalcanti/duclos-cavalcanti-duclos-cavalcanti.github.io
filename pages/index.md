# Hi!
<hr />

My name is *Daniel Duclos-Cavalcanti* and I am an American and Brazilian Electrical/Computer Engineer currently living in Munich, Germany. I have completed my B.Sc. at the Technical University of Munich ([TUM](https://www.tum.de/)), where I've also enrolled in my M.Sc. in the very same field. As of now I am in my very last semester of this degree, which means I'm currently looking for Master Thesis opportunities both within an Academic and if possible an Industrial setting. My general interests as a computer scientist lie within:

+ Operating Systems 
+ Compilers 
+ Natural Language Processing 
+ TinyML / Machine Learning on Embedded Systems

Feel free to look around and to reach out to me either on Github, Linkedin or Email. The corresponding links can be accessed through the logo's displayed on the top right corner of this page!
