# Daniel Duclos-Cavalcanti

As of now, I am going into my last semester of my Electrical and Computer Engineering Masters Program at TUM. Therefore I am looking for internships in the form of a masters thesis in various fields within Computer Science, Software Engineering, Embedded Systems and Machine Learning.

What once begun as a general interest for programming languages has evolved to a broader curiosity towards computers and cyber-physical systems in their entirety. Embedded Systems and Computer Science in general are central passions of mine, where I find myself continuously interested and engaged with. All low and high level challenges regarding these fields interest me, especially around TinyML or machine learning on embedded devices.

Being born in Minneapolis, USA and having the opportunity to live in Brazil for 12+ years has given me a unique perspective and background on all things from culture to work. Giving me, what I would like to think, different tools on how to approach both people and problems.
