# About
<hr />

American/Brazilian Computer Engineer finishing off a M.Sc. in ECE through an exchange at NYU's Graduate School of Arts and Science. I'm currently living in New York and am searching for full-time roles to further my stay in the city, as well as move into the next chapter of my career in Software/Computer Engineering.

I earned my B.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering by the Technical University of Munich, where from I also will soon receive my masters degree from as well.

I was born in the United States, more specifically in Minneapolis. However, I've lived most of my formative years in Brazil, where my family takes up residence. Eventually, my studies brought me to Germany, where I've pursued a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Technical University of Munich.

What once begun as a general interest for programming languages has evolved to a broader curiosity towards computers, algorithms, digital electronics and cyber-physical systems in their entirety. All challenge's both at high and low level's of computational abstraction interest me and peak my curiosity in different ways.

## Interests

+ Operating Systems 
- Virtualization and Containerization
- Distributed Systems and Networks
- High-Performance Computing

Since my first programming class, I guess the will to understand programs and the machines that execute them 
eventually brought me both to study electronics and then later on the software abstractions that leverage 
hardware into a cohesive system -- Operating Systems. Everything that interfaces with Kernel Enginering 
both in the singular or plural context of computation intrigue me.

## Experience

+ Operating Systems (Linux), as well as Real-Time OSs (RTOS)
+ Embedded/FPGA and SoC/System Development
+ TinyML
+ Toolchains/CI/CD
+ Digital Design 

Check out my [__RESUME__](/resume) for more in-depth details.

## Tooling

On some level, I do believe that mastering one's tools are as important as understanding 
the craft itself. Either that, or I just love procrastinating through endlessly hacking.

Regardless, as somewhat of a hobby, when I'm not engaged in topics mentioned above, I find myself continuously learning and interested in all things UNIX. That goes from the their tools, the OSes themselves and 
extending both of them for my needs. 

I use the infamous UNIX clone - _Linux_ - on a daily basis and have done so for a long time. I am quite fond of the experience, the strong freedom within it's ecosystem and user base.

## Etc

Beyond computer science I have a variety of different interests. These go from Language and Linguistics to Comedy, Rap and even martial arts.

I am a huge fan of *Stand-up Comedy* and have been since I first saw it as a kid. Among many contemporaries, I'd say my favorite current comedians would be *Dave Chapelle*, *Bill Burr*, *Ricky Gervais* and *Andrew Schulz*.

*American Rap* has also been my music of choice since I can remember, there is something about the raw expression and linguistic exercise of this art form that has always drawn me in.
