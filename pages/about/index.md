# About
<hr />

I'm Daniel Duclos-Cavalcanti and I am a Computer Scientist/Electrial Engineer from the Technical University of Munich, in Germany.
I was born in Minneapolis, USA. However, I've lived most of my early life in Brazil, where my parents and family come from. My studies brought me to Germany, where I've pursued a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Technical University of Munich.

What once begun as a general interest for programming languages has evolved to a broader curiosity towards computers, algorithms, digital electronics and cyber-physical systems in their entirety. 

## Expertise and Interests

+ Operating Systems 
+ Compilers 
+ Natural Language Processing 

## Tools

I find myself continuously engaged and interested in UNIX systems, their tools and hacking on them for my own needs. I use the infamous UNIX clone ([Linux](https://www.linux.org/pages/download/)) on a daily basis and have done so for a long time. I am quite fond of the experience, the strong freedom within it's ecosystem and user base.

## Etc

Beyond computer science I like a lot of things. I am a huge fan of *Stand-up Comedy* and have been since I first saw a show as a kid. Among many contemporaries, I'd say my favorite current comedians would be *Dave Chapelle*, *Bill Burr*, *Ricky Gervais* and *Andrew Schulz*.

*American Rap* has also been my music of choice since I can remember, there is something about the raw expression and linguistic exercise 
of this art form that has always drawn me in. I couldn't imagine my life without it as an outlet.
