# About
<hr />

Being born in Minneapolis, USA and having the opportunity to live in Brazil for 12+ years has given me a unique perspective and background on all things from culture to work. I would like to think these experiences help me on how to approach both people and problems in different environments.

What once begun as a general interest for programming languages has evolved to a broader curiosity towards computers and cyber-physical systems in their entirety. I find myself continuously engaged and interested in Unix systems and their compelling role in computing history. Personally, I use the infamous unix clone, [Linux](https://www.linux.org/pages/download/), on a daily basis and have done so for a long time. I am quite fond of the experience due to the strong freedom one has within it's ecosystem, from the tools to the kernel itself!

## Interests in Life
<hr />

Beyond computer science I like a lot of things. I am a huge fan of *Stand-up Comedy* and have been since I first saw a show as a kid. Among many contemporaries, I'd say my favorite current comedians would be *Dave Chapelle*, *Bill Burr*, *Ricky Gervais* and *Andrew Schulz*.

*American Rap* has also been my music of choice since I can remember, there is something about the raw expression and linguistic exercise 
of this art form that has always drawn me in. I couldn't imagine my life without it as an outlet.
