# About
<hr />

I'm a Computer and Electrical Engineer from the Technical University of Munich. Currently, finishing a [M.Sc. Degree](https://github.com/duclos-cavalcanti/master-arbeit) through a visiting graduate student program at the [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/). 
I'm collaborating with [Dr.Sivaraman](https://anirudhsk.github.io/) and his research team at [Systems@NYU](https://news.cs.nyu.edu/) on a project around a high-performant and scalable multicasting solution for financial exchange's in the cloud.

I earned my B.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering by the Technical University of Munich, where from I also will soon receive my masters degree from as well.

I was born in the United States, more specifically in Minneapolis. However, I've lived most of my formative years in Brazil, where my family takes up residence. Eventually, my studies brought me to Germany, where I've pursued a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. in ECE.

## Background, Interests and Experience

Interests | Experience |
---|---|
Operating Systems           | Linux, as well as Real-Time OSes (FreeRTOS) |
Distributed Systems         | Embedded/FPGA/SoC and System Development |
Network Engineering         | Kernel Networking Stack, TCP/DUP, ZeroMQ |
Tooling                     | Scripting/Toolchains/CI/CD |
Containerization            | Docker |
High Performance Computing  | OpenMPI, OpenMP |
AI/ML                       | TinyML, Tensorflow, TFLite |

Since my first programming class I had the will to understand programs and the machines that execute them.
This eventually brought me both to study electronics and then later on the software mechanisms that leverage 
hardware into a cohesive system. These topics stretched from operating systems, distributed systems, 
computer networking to even embedded processors, systems-on-chip and FPGAs.

Check out my [__RESUME__](/resume) for more in-depth details.

## Tooling

On some level, I do believe that mastering one's tools are as important as understanding 
the craft itself. Either that, or I just enjoy endless hacking.

Regardless, as somewhat of a hobby, when I'm not engaged in topics mentioned above, I find myself continuously learning and interested in all things UNIX. That goes from the their tools, the OSes themselves and 
extending both of them for my needs. 

I use the infamous UNIX clone - _Linux_ - on a daily basis and have done so for a long time. I am quite fond of the experience, the strong freedom within it's ecosystem and user base.

## Etc

Beyond computer science I have a variety of different interests. These go from Language and Linguistics to Comedy, Rap and even martial arts.

I am a huge fan of *Stand-up Comedy* and have been since I first saw it as a kid. Among many contemporaries, I'd say my favorite current comedians would be *Dave Chapelle*, *Ricky Gervais* and *Andrew Schulz*.

*American Rap* has also been my music of choice since I can remember, there is something about the raw expression and linguistic exercise of this art form that has always drawn me in.
