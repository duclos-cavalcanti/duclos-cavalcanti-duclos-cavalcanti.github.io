# About
<hr />

My name is Daniel Duclos-Cavalcanti, I'm a Computer Engineer currently living in New York City, USA. 

I was born in the United States, more specifically in Minneapolis. However, I've lived most of my formative years in Brazil, where my family takes up residence. Eventually, my studies brought me to Germany, where I've pursued a B.Sc. and a M.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Technical University of Munich.

What once begun as a general interest for programming languages has evolved to a broader curiosity towards computers, algorithms, digital electronics and cyber-physical systems in their entirety. All challenge's both at high and low level's of computational abstraction interest me and peak my curiosity in different ways.

## Interests

+ Operating Systems

Since my first programming class, I guess the will to understand programs and the machines that execute them 
eventually brought me both to study digital electronics and then later on the software abstractions that enable us 
to use computers - Operating Systems. They are, for me at least, at the heart of computer science and beautifully tie hardware and software into a single system and play a huge part in so many fields and applications.

+ Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Currently, as many already, I've been drawn in by the NLP hype with amazing contributions that have hit the mainstream, such as [Chat-GPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) and it's different versions. Initially, there was a general curiosity that led me to dive into this topic, however at this moment it has grown into much more. 

I am not only deeply interested in the science and its various applications, but the linguistics component to this field means to me just as much. Being born in a bilingual household, language has always been present in my life as more than a means to an end. Different languages have shown me different perspectives on how to transmit information, how to approach a subject, how to express myself. I've lead life with with what I believed were two separate passions: language and science. Now, even though a tad late to the party, I've found the one thing that these two become one and that excites me tremendously.

I really feel that human language is one of the most transforming technologies we've ever developed. In this day and age, being able to reproduce language understanding within computers is just a fascinating and mind-bending task. Being able to be a part of this movement in itself is already all the fulfillment I could ask for.

## Experience

+ TinyML
+ Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS) 
+ Digital Design 
+ System/Embedded Development
+ Toolchains/CI/CD

## Tooling

On some level, I do believe that mastering one's tools are as important as understanding 
the craft itself. Either that, or I just love procrastinating through endlessly hacking.

Regardless, as somewhat of a hobby, when I'm not engaged in topics mentioned above, I find myself continuously learning and interested in all things UNIX. That goes from the their tools, the OSes themselves and 
extending both of them for my needs. 

I use the infamous UNIX clone - _Linux_ - on a daily basis and have done so for a long time. I am quite fond of the experience, the strong freedom within it's ecosystem and user base.

## Etc

Beyond computer science I have a variety of different interests. These go from Language and Linguistics to Comedy, Rap and even martial arts.

I am a huge fan of *Stand-up Comedy* and have been since I first saw it as a kid. Among many contemporaries, I'd say my favorite current comedians would be *Dave Chapelle*, *Bill Burr*, *Ricky Gervais* and *Andrew Schulz*.

*American Rap* has also been my music of choice since I can remember, there is something about the raw expression and linguistic exercise of this art form that has always drawn me in.
