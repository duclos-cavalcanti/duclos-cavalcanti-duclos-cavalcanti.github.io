      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Computer and Electrical Engineer from the Technical University of Munich, where I&amp;rsquo;m also soon to receive a M.Sc. Degree from as well. I was born in the United States, more specifically in Minneapolis. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve lived most of my formative years in Brazil, where my family takes up residence. Eventually, my studies brought me to Germany, but today, I am living in New York and am looking for full-time positions in the region within Computer Engineering ideally from September on, but could start earlier given the circumstances.</description>

      <description>Projects FreeRTOS Space-Invaders  A loosely based version of the classic arcade video game developed by Tomohiro Nishikado and released in 1978. The work was written in C and done so as a multi-threaded FreeRTOS application based upon an available emulator.
  C FreeRTOS Multi-threaded  Value Iteration with OpenMPI  An asynchronous value iteration model implemented as a dynamic programming problem. Done so using Open-MPI to distribute the workload across different machines at a cluster made available by the university.</description>
